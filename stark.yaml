    Game of Thrones
    ---------------
    
    Eddard learns that [arryn], the man who raised him and [robert], has died. [robert],
    now the King of Westeros, comes to visit him. During his visit, [robert Robert] names
    Eddard Hand of the King, his right-hand man. While Eddard is reluctant, [catelyn
    Catelyn] encourages him after a letter from [lyssa], her sister, arrives. The letter
    accuses the [lannister]s of murdering [arryn], her husband, and Eddard decides to get
    to the bottom of it - and protect [robert Robert].

    Journeying south with [robert Robert], [sansa Sansa], and [arya Arya], along with all
    of [robert Robert]'s royal retainers, Eddard makes his way to [kingslanding]. There is
    an incident along the way involving his daughters and [joffrey Prince Joffrey].
    [robert Robert]'s wife, [cersei], forces Eddard to kill [sansa Sansa]'s wolf as
    punishment.

    After the attempt on [bran]'s life, [catelyn Catelyn] rides south to meet Eddard and
    warn him. With [petyr Littlefinger]'s help, the two meet, and discuss the plot to kill
    their son. Upon leaving, however, Eddard is ambushed by [jamie], and all of his men
    are slain. Eddard is wounded in the skirmish.

    Eddard goes to [pycell Grand Maester Pycell], and asks what [arryn] was researching
    before his death. [pycell Grand Maester Pycell] reveals that he had been helping
    [arryn Arryn] research the history of [baratheon]. Eddard pores over the last book
    read by [arryn], and discovers that all baratheons have been black of hair, back to
    the foundation of their line. This means that [joffrey Joffrey], [tommen Tommen], and
    [myrcella] are likely bastards - not heir to the throne.

    Eddard threatens [cersei] with this information. Before he can act on it, however,
    [robert King Robert] is slain by his quarry when hunting boar.

    Upon his deathbed, [robert Robert] names Eddard lord regent of the realm, until
    [joffrey his son] comes of age. [renly] approaches Eddard, begging him to seize the
    throne, before [cersei] can make a move. Eddard, however, thinks this to be
    dishonorable and dishonest.

    Eddard delivers [robert]'s final words to the court, declaring himself lord protector.
    He is confident that [petyr] will defend his claim, as captain of the city guard.
    [cersei], however, has already paid him off - the court turns on Eddard, and he is
    imprisoned.

    Eddard is visited once by [varys] while he is imprisoned. [sansa] speaks before the
    whole court, begging [joffrey King Joffrey] to spare his life. [cersei] tells him that
    he should banish Eddard to The Wall, and he agrees - if Eddard will admit to his
    treason.

    Finally, Eddard is brought to the Sept of Baelor, before all the commonfolk of King's
    Landing, to publicly admit his wrongdoing, and his treason. [joffrey Joffrey] reneges
    on his previous generosity, however, and has Eddard beheaded regardless, while his
    daughter [arya] looks on.

    [joffrey King Joffrey] has Eddard's head tarred, and impaled on a spike. He then
    forces [sansa] to look upon the heads of her father and his men.

    Eddards bones are eventually retrieved, on [catelyn]'s demand, and are sent north -
    back to Winterfell.
